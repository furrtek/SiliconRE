External reverb RAM, address and data bus shared with PCM samples ROM. Can work in pairs.
Can reverb RAM be shared ?

Pinout from Racing Force schematics.

Channel data in 00~FF is stored in two 128-byte odd/even RAM blocks with full read/write access. Several addresses are used for internal storage of channel state and values. Access slots are tightly interleaved (1/4) so there's no CPU access delay.
The current internal RAM access address comes from a lookup table stored in ROM A, which is read in a linear way during a 384-cycle (32 * 12) period.

Samplerate:
Racing Force TOPCK = 18MHz
Soccer Superstars = 18.43200MHz

ROMA: 384 * 7 bits
ROMB: 192 * 16 bits

MULA: 8 * 16 = 24 LSB
MULB: 16 * 16 = 16 MSB

# Schematic notes

All cells are placed and connected, all pins are connected, ERC passes.

Many nets and busses aren't named or correctly named yet.

Several cells such as MUX21D, MUX41, LATCHN,... use shared differential control signals.
To reduce clutter, only the true signals are shown (the /S input on MUX21D for example is always the inverse of S).
This is why there are several inverters with unconnected outputs.

MUX41N must have their inputs in the reverse order and true/inverted control signals swapped given the order in which bus bits are connected. Couldn't know the "right" way because no documentation. Doesn't actually change anything though, so I'm leaving them like they are. 

# Data paths

 * Bidirectional path between DB[7:0] and RD[7:0], for POST of external RAM.
 * Bidirectional path between RAM_A_DOUT[7:0]/RAM_A_DIN[7:0] and DB[7:0], for CPU access of odd values.
 * Bidirectional path between RAM_B_DOUT[7:0]/RAM_B_DIN[7:0] and DB[7:0], for CPU access of even values.
 * Path from ROMA_D[6:0] to RA[6:0], for factory testing of ROMA.
 * Path from ROMB_D[15:0] to RA[15:0], for factory testing of ROMB.

 * Path from RD[7:0] to MULA_A[7:0], for factory testing (TESTREG1_D3).
 * Path from {AB[7:0], DB[7:0]} to MULA_B[15:0], for factory testing (TESTREG1_D3).
 * Path from MULA_OUT[23:0] to RA[23:0], for factory testing.

 * Path from {AXXA, AXDA, ALRA, AXWA, RRMD, USE2, DTS2, DTS1, RD[7:0]} to MULB_A[15:0], for factory testing (TESTREG1_D1).
 * Path from {AB[7:0], DB[7:0]} to MULB_B[15:0], for factory testing (TESTREG1_D1).
 * Path from MULB_OUT[15:0] to RA[15:0], for factory testing.

# Adders

ADDERA 40-bit pitch accumulator ? Value is stored in internal RAM
ADDA[39:32]	RAMA
ADDA[31:24]	RAMA
ADDA[23:16]	RAMB
ADDA[15:8]	RAMA
ADDA[7:0]	RAMB
Adds {0, 0, MUXB, MUXA, MUXB} (24 bits, probably pitch delta) to {MUXA, MUXA, MUXB, MUXA, MUXB} (40 bits)
Top 24 bits of {MUXA, MUXA, MUXB, MUXA, MUXB} used as address offset

ADDERB 24-bit adds channel start address or loop point (BASE[23:0]) + offset for ext address output (OFFS[23:0]).

OFFS[23:0] comes from ADDA_LAT_B[23:0] (inverted, or shifted depending on data format and reverse flag).

{RD_REG[7:0], RD_REG2[7:0]} can go to MUXD[15:0].

ADDERC 16-bit accumulates sample value with delta STEP[15:0] + {RAMA, RAMB}.

MUXD[15:0] is the sample value from ADDERC accumulator or directly from RAM: {RD_REG[7:0], RD_REG2[7:0]}.

# Sample data

MAME:
Even[3:2]=00: 8-bit PCM, end of sample marked as 0x80.
Even[3:2]=01: 16-bit PCM, end of sample marked as 0x8000.
Even[3:2]=10: 4-bit DPCM, end of sample marked as 0x88.

End of samples marked as 0x80 or 0x8000.

# Adder E

Channel mixer / accumulator ?: 10 bit (MULA_OUT[23:14]) + 24 bit (MULA_OUT[23:0])

Output mixer / accumulator: three pairs of 16 bit registers (MULB_OUT[15:0] + REGEA/B/C/D/E/F)
Three final outputs * 2 channels
REGED ends up in the FRDL PISO
REGEB ends up in the FRDT PISO
REGEC ends up in the REDL PISO
REGEA ends up in THE REDT PISO
REGEE and REGEF end up in the final output PISO

Start/loop loads seem to be done from 08 09 0A 0B instead of 04 05 06 07. Maybe they're copied on channel start ?
Actually, for each channel the values in 00~0F (00~07 IRAM address) are maybe copied to 10~1F (08~0F IRAM address) to allow the sound program to update channel parameters while they are playing, and only apply them on key on.
