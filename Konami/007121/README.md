# Registers

`Unused` means that there's no latch for the given bit, writing to it does nothing.

* Register 0: X scroll value, lower 8 bits
* Register 1:
  * Bit 7: Forces pin NRM low (which pin is NRM?)
  * Bit 6~4: Unused
  * Bit 3: Select text mode when high. Layout related
  * Bit 2: 0=Row scrolling, 1=Column scrolling
  * Bit 1: Enable row/column scrolling
  * Bit 0: X scroll value, higher bit
* Register 2: Y scroll value
* Register 3:
  * Bit 7: Unused
  * Bit 6: Blanking related. According to MAME, the effect is to
           removed the leftmost and rightmost columns of the image
  * Bit 5: Priority related, selects between S7 or P8
  * Bit 4: Selects text mode when low. Layout related
           Limits the part of the image where sprites can appear (CC39)
  * Bit 3: There are two sprite tables, this bit selects the active one
           (highest VRAM address bit when parsing sprite list $0000/$8000)
  * Bit 2: Priority related, opaque sprite pixels have highest priority
  * Bit 1: Unused
  * Bit 0: Highest gfx ROM address bit for scroll layer tile fetches (tile code bit 13, pin R17)
* Register 4:
  * Bit 7: Scroll layer tile code bit 12, 0=From data selected by register 5, 1=Directly from register 4 bit 3
  * Bit 6: Scroll layer tile code bit 11, 0=From data selected by register 5, 1=Directly from register 4 bit 2
  * Bit 5: Scroll layer tile code bit 10, 0=From data selected by register 5, 1=Directly from register 4 bit 1
  * Bit 4: Scroll layer tile code bit 9, 0=From data selected by register 5, 1=Directly from register 4 bit 0
  * Bit 3~0: Scroll layer tile code bits 12:9, selected individually by the above bits
* Register 5:
  * Bit 7~6: Scroll layer tile code bit 12 comes from VRAM attribute bit 00=3, 01=4, 10=5 or 11=6
  * Bit 5~4: Scroll layer tile code bit 11 comes from VRAM attribute bit 00=3, 01=4, 10=5 or 11=6
  * Bit 3~2: Scroll layer tile code bit 10 comes from VRAM attribute bit 00=3, 01=4, 10=5 or 11=6
  * Bit 1~0: Scroll layer tile code bit 9 comes from VRAM attribute bit 00=3, 01=4, 10=5 or 11=6
* Register 6:
  * Bit 7~6: Unused
  * Bit 5: Final color output bit 6 (pin COA6)
  * Bit 4: Final color output bit 5 (pin COA5)
  * Bit 3: Enable bit 6 of scroll layer tile attribute as priority flag
  * Bit 2: Enable bit 5 of scroll layer tile attribute as Y flip flag
  * Bit 1: Enable bit 4 of scroll layer tile attribute as inversion of lowest gfx ROM address bit for scroll layer tile fetches (X flip flag ?)
  * Bit 0: Enable bit 3 of scroll layer tile attribute as highest color lookup address (pin VCB3)
* Register 7:
  * Bit 7~5: Unused
  * Bit 4: Select NMI repetition rate 0=32 scanlines, 1=64 scanlines
  * Bit 3: Flip display in both X and Y
  * Bit 2: Enable FIRQs. Pulse it to clear an active FIRQ request.
  * Bit 1: Enable IRQs. Pulse it to clear an active IRQ request.
  * Bit 0: Enable NMIs. Pulse it to clear an active NMI request.

# Interrupts

The chip can produce the three interrupts supported by the M6809 CPU:

*  NMI: every 32 scanlines (Reg7[4] low) or 64 (Reg7[4] high)
*  IRQ: at the same time /VBLANK goes high
* FIRQ: each time /IRQ is cleared, /FIRQ toggles

# Priority

Scroll / sprite priority is decided on pages "PRIORITY" and "COLOR OUTPUT".

The tile priority bit is the tilemap attribute bit 6 when reg 6 bit 3 is high, otherwise it is set to 0.
It's loaded in the same kind of 8-bit shift register used for the tile's pixels, so once loaded it stays the same for a given 8-pixel row.
The output of the shift register is finally used only if reg 3 bits 2 and 5 are set.
If the priority bit is set, and the current pixel is opaque (color isn't zero), then opaque scroll pixels have priority.

If reg 3 bit 2 is set, bit 5 is low, and P6 (wrong ? doesn't make sense) is high, then all scroll pixels have priority ?

If reg 3 bit 2 is low, then both scroll and sprite priority bits are unused. Opaque sprite pixels are given priority.

# Color output

Pins COA0-COA3 represent the final 4bpp pixel. COA4 indicates 0=Sprite pixel, 1=Scroll pixel. COA5 and COA6 are set by reg 6 bits 4 and 5.
During blanking, only COA0-COA3 are set to 0. COA4-COA6 continue functioning like in the active display.
When pin NWCS is low, the CPU address bus A1-A7 are routed to pins COA0-COA6. This has priority over blanking.

COA bit | Meaning
--------|--------------------------
6       | set by register 6, bit 5
5       | set by register 6, bit 4
4       | 0=sprite 1=scroll
3:0     | Final pixel color

# Line buffers

GFX ROM data bus is 16 bit wide = 4 * 4bpp pixels.

Sprite pixels are written to DRAM 2 by 2 (2 * 4bpp), they're also read out 2 by 2 and split in turn to go into the priority circuit.

# Scroll RAM

May be used for row or column scrolling. A row or column is 8 pixels.

* Row scrolling: register 0 (X scroll) is overridden.
* Column scrolling: register 2 (Y scroll) is overridden.

Note that if the row is set to text mode, the scroll mux output is always zero.

It is not a regular RAM block, but 288 latches to store 32 9-bit values (only 8 bits used for column scrolling).

The latch data input comes from a 2-to-1 mux to either store a new value written by the CPU, or the value from SCROLL_OUTx (to keep the previous one)

Memory mapping:
* 20:3F = lower 8 bits
* 40:5F = highest bit in b0

x01x xxxx = low
x10x xxxx = high

A6 selects low 8 bits/highest bit
0x00 0000

Reading:
If below $2000, read scroll RAM

# Sprites

There are two sprite tables in memory, selectable via bit Reg3[3]. The table is
addressed by a 11-bit up counter.

COUNTER1 is enabled only when size=011 ? Doesn't make sense.

Tilemap is made of pairs of code-attribute bytes for each tile ?
