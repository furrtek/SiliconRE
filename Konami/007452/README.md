# Multiplier

7-bit operand A * 8-bit operand B -> 15-bit result.

* Write to 0: Set operand A
* Write to 1: Set operand B and trigger multiplication process
* Read from 0: Get result lower byte
* Read from 1: Get result upper byte

Result is valid 8+2 clocks after writing to register 1.

Operand A's MSB **must** be zero or the result will be incorrect. The result's upper byte MSB is always zero.

# Divider

16-bit dividend / 16-bit divisor -> 16-bit quotient, 16-bit remainder.

* Write to 2: Set divisor upper byte
* Write to 3: Set divisor lower byte
* Write to 4: Set dividend upper byte
* Write to 5: Set dividend lower byte and trigger division process
* Read from 2: Get remainder lower byte
* Read from 3: Get remainder top byte
* Read from 4: Get quotient lower byte
* Read from 5: Get quotient top byte

Result is valid 16+2 clocks after writing to register 5.

# Bankswitching

Has four 6-bit registers whose values are output on Y[6:1] depending on the AB[14:13] inputs.
Didn't spend time trying to understand what's happening in detail, sorry.

* Register 5xxx: Set bank 1
* Register 7xxx: Set bank 2
* Register 9xxx: Set bank 3
* Register Bxxx: Set bank 4
